This repository contains the code and instructions to create a simple blockchain from scratch using Python.



Overview

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network. This technology was originally introduced to support cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but it has many other potential use cases beyond that.

In this, I created a simple blockchain that can handle the following tasks:

Create a new block
Add a block to the blockchain
Retrieve the entire blockchain
and gives data back in the form of string.
